  ‚éø ¬†Read src/components/OutfitSelectionModal.js (425 lines)
  ‚éø ¬†Todo list read (3 items)

‚óè Looking at the HomeScreen.js file, I can see that the custom image display logic is
  already properly implemented for all four outfit buttons (head, torso, legs, feet).
  However, I notice that the customOutfitImage style is referenced but not defined in the
  responsive styles object. Let me add this missing style definition to complete the fix.

‚óè Update(src/screens/HomeScreen.js)
  ‚éø ¬†Updated src/screens/HomeScreen.js with 6 additions                                    
       211          marginTop: isSmallScreen ? screenHeight * 0.005 : isMediumScreen ? 
             screenHeight * 0.008 : screenHeight * 0.015,
       212          marginBottom: isSmallScreen ? screenHeight * 0.005 : isMediumScreen ? 
             screenHeight * 0.008 : screenHeight * 0.015,
       213        },
       214 +      
       215 +      customOutfitImage: {
       216 +        width: isSmallScreen ? screenWidth * 0.08 : isMediumScreen ? 
     screenWidth
           +  * 0.09 : screenWidth * 0.12,
       217 +        height: isSmallScreen ? screenWidth * 0.08 : isMediumScreen ? 
           + screenWidth * 0.09 : screenWidth * 0.12,
       218 +        borderRadius: Sizes.borderRadius.small,
       219 +      },
       220      });
       221    
       222      const responsiveStyles = getResponsiveStyles();

‚óè Perfect! I've added the missing customOutfitImage style definition to the responsive
  styles object. The style:

  1. Matches icon sizes: Uses the same responsive sizing as the outfit icons (8-12% of
  screen width)
  2. Square dimensions: Equal width and height for consistent appearance
  3. Rounded corners: Uses the small border radius for a polished look

  The fix is now complete. Custom clothing photos will display properly on the main page
  outfit buttons instead of showing camera icons, with proper responsive sizing that
  matches the existing design system.
